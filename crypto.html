		<h1>Cringe Crypto Hot Takes</h1>
		<p>Bitcoin was a digital currency software project that successfully implemented natural scarcity, therefore giving the currency value.</p>
		<p>The main breakthrough was blockchain technology. This is where each transaction is passed to a third party 'miner' who'll encode it into a 'block', which takes the transaction and encodes it with the previous block, along with a lot of junk calculations, and then pushes the new block to the network. Because of all the extra calculations, any lies about a transaction would have to be backed up by redoing all of the junk calculations for each of the previous blocks up until the transaction, which would be computationally uneconomical.<p>
		<p>This technology allowed people to make money in 3 ways:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><p><b>Mining:</b> This used to be as simple as letting a spare computer mine in the background, but now competition to mine has reached the point that only specialized mining hardware can mine more than it's energy bill.</p></li>
			<li><p><b>Doing illegal stuff:</b> Despite it's public ledger, bitcoin is still more convenient for internet crime than cash, 'bitcoin mixers' are services that make it more difficult to follow a bitcoin trail from the public ledger.</p></li>
			<li><p><b>Betting:</b> Bitcoin's value isn't tied to anything concrete, so there is money to be made by buying low and selling high, just like stock trading.</p></li>
		</ol>
		<p>More privacy oriented cryptocurrencies have solved the public ledger problem, and are replacing bitcoin for cybercrime. Some newer cryptocurrencies are also offering alternatives to bitcoin's 'proof of work' way of doing things using alternatives to the junk calculations, with the goal of preventing the massive electricity cost of mining.</p>
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>People hear about how much money they could've made by getting in early with bitcoin and don't want to miss out again. As far as most of these people are concerned, adoption is the only difference between a successful and unsuccessful cypto project. This is why all it takes is the illusion of hype for people to invest in a crypto project.</p>
		<p>This is where internet celebrities come into play, they buy up some digitally scarce goods from a new crypto project, promote it to their fans, and sell quickly before anyone else. This is usually done at launch, with the crypto project developers sometimes being in on it.</p>
		<p>If an internet celebrity knew how to make money using a new technology, then sharing their knowledge would surely be the last thing they'd do. If it's being promoted as a new and important technology, that doesn't make sense either since people with a need for that technology will surely find out about it anyway and it'll be adopted naturally, no influencer required.</p>
		<h3>Actual uses for crypto</h3>
		<p>This all servers to drive attention and development away from the actually useful crypto projects, such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Giving DNS providers less control over the internet with blockchain DNS.</p></li>
			<li><p>Preserving information forever using blockchain file storage.</p></li>
			<li><p>Token based proof of identity so people don't have to associate the same phone number with all their accounts.</p></li>
			<li><p><b>Not</b> selling digital ownership of Google Drive links to PNGs.</p></li>
		</ul>
