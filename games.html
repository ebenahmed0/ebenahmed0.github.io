		<h1>Some videogames</h1>
		<p>Short list of a few videogames I've played and personally had a fun experience with, not very exhaustive or objective.</p>
		<h3>Deus Ex</h3>
		<p>Very enjoyable over-the-top conspiracy thriller story where you take the role of a cyborg counter-terrorist and uncover a global conspiracy involving a lot or real life conspiracy theories mixed together, without being too serious about it. The gameplay is focused on giving the player a choice of approaches, with a progression system that complements this while being the perfect level of complexity. This game is pretty ugly, if this puts you off then the best thing to do is play with the Deus Ex: Revision mod (which is free on steam), this is much preferred over enduring the prequels.</p>
		<h3>Metal Gear Solid franchise</h3>
		<p>Interesting story which feels like a less boring James Bond plot with very fun characters. Gameplay is mostly stealth with some occasional backtracking, with the boss fights being the stand out best parts.</p>
		<h3>Tom Clancy's Rainbox Six: Siege</h3>
		<p>Competitive shooting game with lots of destructible elements and different features. It used to be fun to find new strategies and ways to use the various gameplay elements together to catch the enemy off guard, though the 'meta' has mostly caught on and the interesting 'tactical possibilities' have been used to death.</p>
		<h3>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h3>
		<p>Competitive shooting game designed with a 'skill curve' in mind, so players artificially have specific parts of the gameplay that they can learn to improve at the game. Don't try too hard or you'll end up in a skill group where you have to play at your best all the time.</p>
		<h3>Battlefield 4</h3>
		<p>Battlefield 4's conquest large mode is just the right amount of players in the right size map with the right amount of gameplay elements to make war sandbox with enough ways for the player to approach that it never get boring.<p/>
		<h3>DayZ</h3>
		<p>DayZ throws players into a world with scarce food, diseases, zombies and some military hardware for them to fight over. The game is usually fairly boring, but you set your own stakes by collecting loot, working toward an inventory full of stuff to help you survive, all whilst it could immediately be taken away by an unfriendly player who sees you before you see them. This creates intense situations completely organically, and leads to some very memorable gameplay.</p>
		<h3>Infra</h3>
		<p>This game is fairly boring, I enjoy it for it's mood of urban adventure and isolation. Your character is sent to survey some city infrastructure, which takes him through various parts of the city, providing various obstacles with a main story told directly, and further stories told through notes.</p>
		<h3>Mirror's Edge</h3>
		<p>Mirror's Edge is a pretty bad game overall, but it's freerunning gameplay can be fun, especially when challenging yourself to complete each level as quickly as possible.</p>
