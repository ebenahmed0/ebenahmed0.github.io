		<h3>Freetube</h3>
		<p>Desktop app for YouTube. Doesn't use a Google account, just keeps an offline subscription list. This is the least annoying way I can find for fetching my YouTube subscription feed completely through tor.</p>

		<h3>Flameshot</h3>
		<p>Replacement for built-in screenshot tools. Lets you select a portion of the screen and do pretty much anything with it.</p>

		<h3>Deadbeef</h3>
		<p>Music player that lets you move the UI elements about easily and has a playlists-as-tabs layout. Also has very good tag editing.</p>

		<br>
		<h3>Onionshare</h3>
		<p>Lets you host a 'Darkweb' site for sending files, receiving files or a chat service in a few clicks without any setup accessible from the Tor Browser. Utilises the decentralised nature of Tor to make these things that would usually be fairly difficult to set up automatic from a simple app.</p>

		<h3>Tiling window managers</h3>
		<p>On Windows, Mac and all of the popular Linux desktops you position your open applications by dragging the windows into the right place, these are 'floating' window managers. Typically with 'tiling' window managers, with 1 window open, it'll allways be maximised and with 2 windows they'll each take up half the screen and so on. This saves time that would be spent moving the windows and, combined with keyboard-operable alternatives to the software being used, can let you use the machine without a mouse entierly. Unfortunately most programs are made specifically with floating window managers in mind, so programs can look weird when forced to be a certain size like this.</p>
