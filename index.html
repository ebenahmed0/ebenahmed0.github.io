<h1>Eben Ahmed's Personal Site</h1>
<p>Welcome to my personal site. I'm a digital marketer based in the Midlands. My interests include video games, software, anime, films and YouTube infotainment.</p>
<br><hr><br>
<p>Use an actual password manager, Bitwarden is good if you need cloud sync and KeePassXC is better if you don't. If you're on Windows make sure to enable file name extensions from the file manager settings so you don't get bamboozled by a malicious .exe disguised as a folder. Use web versions of closed-source software wherever possible, programs like spotify and discord are just packaged web apps with almost identical functions to the web versions, apart from the security/privacy risks of having more software installed with non-auditable code.</p>
<br><hr><br>
<p>All things capable of self replication exhibit generational changes, eventually establishing a positive feedback loop that results in their self-extinction. For organic life on earth, this feedback loop is gaming laptop owners.</p>

<hr><br>
<p>If no cure for dementia is found (and after a few engineering problems have been solved) people who are alienated and wealthy enough will eventually resort to extending their life by running their brain within a sufficiently detailed computer simulation, a 'cyberbrain'.</p>
<p>Cyberbrains could interface with the internet directly, allowing people with cyberbrains to contribute their cyberbrain-accepting ideas more effectively, therefore accelerating cyberbrain acceptance.</p>
<p>Many people will come to desire cyberbrain-specific abilities such as: Accelerated thought, direct brain-brain communication, backups, or 'abuse' of direct serotonin/dopamine control.</p>
<p>If cyberbrain standardisation is regulated slower than cyberbrains gain popularity, the cyberbrain industry will likely inherit our current smartphone duopoly. This will be achieved with the embrace,extend and extinguish technique (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish#Examples_by_Microsoft">examples</a>) being used to replace the initial cyberbrain products derived from open research projects with proprietry offering from the companies with huge RND capabilities.</p>
<p>Once people start applying virtualisation to cyberbrains, human conscience will no longer be distinguished from software, with groups using direct brain-brain communication not being distinguished from the individual.</p>
<p>The cyberbrain manufacturers will be held directly responsible for the actions of their users, as the users are now considered just another software component of their cyberbrain product. Cyberbrain manufacturers will then be pressured into policing thoughts directly.</p>
<p>The remaining people who still have organic brains will identify themselves with the words that are so offensive that they would have been banned from cyberbrain-contained thought by the manufacturers.</p>
<p>IDK why I wrote this, sounded funnier in my head and probably won't happen.</p>
